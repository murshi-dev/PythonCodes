'''10.	Write pseudocode and draw flowchart of
a program that allows the user to enter three values.
The values represent hourly pay rate, the number of hours
worked  and percentage of EPF withheld. The program multiplies
the  hourly pay rate by the number of hours worked, giving the gross pay.
Then, it multiplies the gross pay by the EPF percentage, giving the withholding amount.
Finally, it subtracts the withholding amount from the gross pay giving the net pay.'''

hourlyRate=float(input("Enter hourly rate: "))
hoursWorked=float(input("Enter the number of hours worked: "))
EPF=float(input("Enter EPF percentage: "))

grossPay=hourlyRate*hoursWorked
withHoldingAmount=grossPay*(EPF/100)
netPay=grossPay-withHoldingAmount
